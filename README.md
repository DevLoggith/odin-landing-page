# **Landing page project**
  
A landing page created during The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) used to display and solidify my knowledge of **HTML foundations**, **CSS foundations**, and **Flexbox** design. This layout was recreated following the provided design which you can see here:

<img src="/images/reference-imgs/odin-project.png" alt="Landing page project design layout" width=500>

I'm using this project (as well as the recipes website project) as a way to display what I've learned up to this point, what I'm currently proficient at, and to show the quality and accuracy of my code. A kind of snap-shot in time of my skill-set.

I'm always looking to improve not only my coding ability and organization, but also my creative design skills. Open to feedback and constructive criticism to help me improve.

I hope you enjoy and thanks for taking a look!
